# 🌈 PWM LED Fader – ESP32 Multi-Color Light Sequence

Smooth multi-color LED fading using PWM on an ESP32. This sketch drives 5 LEDs with a wave-like fading animation using high-frequency PWM for precise control.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Place 5 LEDs on your breadboard.
2. Connect a **220Ω resistor** between each GPIO pin and the **anode (+)** of each LED.
3. Connect all LED **cathodes (–)** to the **GND rail** on the breadboard.
4. Connect the **GND rail** to any **GND pin** on the ESP32.
5. Upload the `PWM_5LEDs.ino` sketch using Arduino IDE.
6. Enjoy the smooth fading color wave!
